Customer Behavior Data Analysis Project

This project is an end-to-end Data Analytics portfolio project where I analyzed customer shopping behavior using Python, SQL, and Power BI. The goal of this project is to understand customer trends, purchasing patterns, and factors that influence subscriptions or repeat purchases.

This project covers the full data analytics workflow followed in real companies — from raw data to insights and dashboards.

📌 Project Overview

In this project, I performed:

✔️ 1. Data Preparation & EDA (Python)

Loaded the dataset

Cleaned and transformed the data

Handled missing values

Performed exploratory data analysis

Loaded cleaned data into SQL database

✔️ 2. Data Analysis (SQL)

Created tables and inserted cleaned data

Wrote SQL queries to answer business questions

Analyzed customer segments, loyalty, and purchase behavior

Derived insights on which customers are more likely to subscribe

✔️ 3. Dashboard (Power BI)

Connected SQL database to Power BI

Built an interactive dashboard

Created visuals like customer trends, subscription rate, purchase categories

Derived insights for business decisions

✔️ 4. Report & Presentation

Summarized key insights

Prepared a simple presentation (created using Gamma AI)

2. Open the Python Notebook

Run each cell to clean the data

Load the processed data into SQL

3. Run SQL Queries

Create a database

Import the cleaned data

Execute the queries in customer_behavior_sql_queries.sql

4. Open Power BI Dashboard

Connect to your SQL database

Refresh the visuals

📊 Key Insights (Examples)

Returning customers purchased more frequently than new customers.

Subscription rate increased with higher purchase amount.

Customers aged 30–45 showed the highest purchase consistency.

Electronics and Clothing were the most purchased categories.

(You can update these with your real insights.)
